# About This Personal Project
- Planning & Inspiration: I used a similar app in college and found it useful, it was [Phase6](https://www.phase-6.de/)
- Tech Stack (i.e. what technology / frameworks / libraries you used): Html CSS and React / JS, because I wanted to apply all my knowledge  here we've learnt so far
- What I enjoyed: figuring out the importing by file, CSS light / dark theme distinctions!
- What I found challenging: I learnt to hate CSV files for being totally unhinged and there being no standard for it
Links
- Online Hosted Project (if deployed -- deployment is optional but recommended): not deployed as it uses JSON server currently for a database substitute
