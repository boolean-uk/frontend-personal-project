# FRONTEND PERSONAL PROJECT

## About My Frontend Personal Project

 ~ Planning & Inspiration (e.g. include drawings, diagrams, links to sites used to get ideas, etc.)
    - I didn't look for any other websites/workout trackers for inspiration as I want to create an original product. I have attached my initail component tree plan in a file called 'initial-component-tree-workout-app'

 ~Tech Stack (i.e. what technology / frameworks / libraries you used)
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - JavaScript
    - React

 ~Why This Stack
    - I wanted to utilise all the skills I've learn thus far to challenge my knowledge and practise applying these to a frontend application
  
 ~What I Enjoyed
    - I really enjoyed building an app based on my own ideas and hobbies. It's been a challenge at times, especially with the short time period to complete, but it has tested all of my knowledge over the past three months and is rewarding seeing the app come together and be functional.

 ~What I Found Challenging
    - I encountered several challenges through this project, for instance:
        1. Conditionally rendering certain elements on initial page load/when certain buttons are clicked, etc. It was a good challenge using various states and figuring out how to piece all the parts together to make it work.
        2. It was also quite a challenge using some CSS animations so they only run on click, hover, etc. It was good fun being able to crack these problems though.
        3. I initially started by searching for an API to use in this project, but after a day of researching and testing a couple I decided not to pursue it any further for this particular project as I could not get the particular information I wanted. However, it was good practise again to use an API and fetch the data and break this down, even if in the end I decided not to use this.
