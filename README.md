## About My Frontend Personal Project
My final frontend project is a webapp that you can save campaigns, notes, characters and us a dice roller for dungeons and dragons.

## PLANNING AND INSPO
- For my project I wanted to make something as practical and fun to me as possible. 
- So when thinking of what I wanted I ended up landing on a web app that I could use.
- Mainly because I appreciate simplicity sometimes and dnd can be a pretty long game!

## TECH STACK
- For this project I used HTML, CSS, Javascript and React.
- I really enjoy using react and think it was a good choice for this web app.
- I used routing for my page navigation and I think it turned out great and worked with local storage for all of my saving files.
- This was the smartest decision for me as I understood these pretty well and felt confident implimenting them.

## WHAT I ENJOYED
- I really liked the freedom and creativity of this!
- I ended up surprising myself with how much I could do and work out on my own and definitly feel more confident now

## WHAT WAS CHALLENGING
- I found sucuessfully implementing the local storage and getting everything work as I wanted it to the most challenging.
- Although I felt confident it was still a hurdle I had to get over
- But with a moderate amount of googling (an improvement!) I was able to overcome these challenges
