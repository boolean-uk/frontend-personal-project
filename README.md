 - About My Frontend Personal Project
       - Planning & Inspiration _(Inspiration for the project came naturally, however i checked different recipe webpages online to get the structure of how to make mine. )
       - Tech Stack _(I used React framework, javascript and css)_
       - Why This Stack (I discovered that the more ı use this stack the better i get at using it. Since it is one of the most sought after stack by employers, ı want to keep using it to become versatile with it.)
       - What I Enjoyed (Ienjoyed watching the display of my code, the responsiveness and effectiveness)
       - What I Found Challenging(creating the data for different recipes. It took me a day to put them together.Also getting the recipes to display on a fresh page took some time.)
