Planning & Inspiration:
Luckily I was thinking of something to do a while back, so there wasnt much waiting about, but after Jules said told us to make sure it's something you enjoy and not too complicated, so it worked out good for me. The reason I chose this idea was due to being able to use most or most thing's we've been taught so far. I also like using CSS a lot so it was a fun project to design. planning wise in terms of the layout, I kept simple, such as just a title, nav bar and just content on each page, so wasnt too crazy to plan. 

Tech Stack:
 Ive choosen to use HTML, CSS and REACT.JS

What I Found Challenging:
 There was few part's that held me back a while, but the main one was the favourite page. I was struggling to set the favourite button up that once clicked it would send the data to go across to another page, but most of the time it was breaking my page or code. After having Lewis explain one issue that I didnt realise or think about, I managed to get it done the following day. This was the main challenge whilst completing the front end project.
